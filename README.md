# Happy-Birthday-Ronak
i hope you will love it
Happy Birthday dear friend! I dont know why i have created this file and program. i'm also new to C language. Everyone is secretly planning something for you and i thought to wish you in my style so i wrote this code for you and believe me i wrote it my self yes ofcourse in order to code this i have to learn few things but overall its a simple code all the efort is to decorate it. I really frustrated to set each spaces but when finally it completed its look awesome isn't it but one more think that i want to add to this code is a birthday tune i searched a lot find coulddn't find SORRY! But if you want you can play a birthday song in the background XD ;)
I HOPE YOU WILL LOVE IT ! 
Enjoy your day my friend.
